Qestions:
1) delete accout: 
what does "The system will check whether there are
any other records referring to this account, like the ownership on
some groups or publications" mean?  
DO we need to check if the user is other's contact lists or something like that?
Or we can delete it anyway since some of the tables have "on delete cascade" ?

2)
